This is assuming node.js has been installed and is working on your system.

Installing React:
Create a folder in designated location.
	(In the case of the project, this folder is called 'CS160')
In some terminal (can be Git Bash or VS Code), navigate to folder and run: npx create-react-app client
	This will create a folder with all necessary React components inside a folder called client.

Under client/src, .js files can be found. For now, modify App.js with test files App.js.
Further information about code is within the App.js data.

Installing Express:
Create folder in designated location.
	(In the case of the project, this folder is called express and is a separate directory than React installation.)
In some terminal, navigate to the created folder and run npm init.
Run two other commands:
	npm install express --save (to install express modules)
	npm install cors --save (to install cors modules required for working with React)
Create a new .js file called index.js.
Copy-paste hello world code into the index.js file.
To run the .js script, type node index.js in the terminal within the express folder.
Localhost 3001 should currently have a Hello World text output.

* The React application, if running at this time, will switch states to Hello World if you refresh.
* Cors is a security module designed to allow React and Express to talk to each other. It is required for them to interact over HTTP.
* I recommend using VS Code to write and run code.
